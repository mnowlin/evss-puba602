##  Defining Public Policy

-   Public policy is . . .

    -   “Whatever governments choose to do or not do” (Dye)

    -   “The relationship of a governmental unit to its environment”
        (Eyestone)

    -   “A purposive course of action or inaction undertaken by an actor
        or set of actors in dealing with a problem or matter of concern”
        (Anderson)

    -   “The actions, objectives, and pronouncements of governments on
        particular matters, the steps they take (or fail to take) to
        implement them, and the explanations they give for what happens
        (or does not happen)” (Wilson)

    -   “The authoritative allocation of values” (Easton)

## Characteristics of Public Policy

-   Combining definitions 

-   Policy policy is . . .

    -   Not random but purposive and goal oriented

    -   Made by public authorities

    -   Patterns of actions taken over time

    -   A product of demand—a government directed course of action in
        response to pressure about some perceived problem

    -   Positive—deliberate action

    -   Negative—deliberate decision not to take action

    -   Based on values and value conflicts

# Purpose of Public Policy

## Purpose of Public Policy

-   Resolve conflict over scarce resources

-   Regulating behavior

-   Motivating collective action

-   Protecting rights

-   Directing benefits toward the public interest

-   Responses to _market failures_ 

## Markets and Policy: Types of Goods

* Goods vary along two dimensions 
	* Rivalrous 
		* Rival: My consumption prevents your consumption 
		* Non-rival: My consumption _does not_ prevent your consumption
	* Excludability 
		* Excludable: Individuals _can_ be prevented from consuming 
		* Non-excludable: Individuals _can not_ be prevented from consuming

## Types of Goods 
 
* Private goods 
	* Rival and excludable 
	* Market most efficient allocation 

* Public goods 
	* Non-rival and non-excludable 
	* Markets tend to _under produce_ 

## Types of Goods 
 
* Common-pool goods
	* Rival and non-excludable 
	* Markets lead to _over consumption_ 

* Club goods 
	* Non-rival and excludable
	* High barriers to entry 
	* Markets tend toward _natural monopolies_ 
	* Natural monopolies exist when a monopoly is most efficient 

## Market Failures

* Externalities
     * _The actions of one individual (or firm) have a direct, unintentional,  and uncompensated effect on the well-being of other individuals or the profits of other firms_
          * Direct
          * Unintentional
          * Uncompensated

     * Imposes additional costs to society

## Market Failures

* Public goods 
     * Why are public goods under-produced by a market?

* What is the Tragedy of the Commons?

* Collective action problems
     * _Prisoner's Dilemma_: Self-interest vs. group interest
     * Free-riding 

# Studying Public Policy

## Academic Public Policy 

- Who

   -   Political scientists, public administration scholars, economists,
    sociologists, psychologists, historians ...

- How (_Epistemology_)

    -   Scientific method

    -   Post-positivist

## Two Types of Knowledge 

-   Knowledge *in* the policy process

-   Knowledge *of* the policy process


## Knowledge *in*

-   Policy Analysis

    -   What should we do?

    -   *Ex ante*

    -   Statistical methods

    -   Economic methods

    -   Criteria for “best” answer

## Knowledge *in*

-   Policy Evaluation

    -   What have we done?

    -   *Ex post*

    -   Seeks evidence of an empirical casual relationship between the
        policy and the outcome

## Knowledge *of* 

-   The how and why of policymaking

-   Why governments pay attention to some problems and not others

-   Why policy changes (or remains stable)

-   How individuals and groups affect policy

-   Where policy comes from
