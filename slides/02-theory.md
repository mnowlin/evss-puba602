# A Theory of the Policy Process?

## Policy Theory 

-  Is there a unified theory of public policy?

-  _It seems like a lot of fuss to me – what does it really matter?_ 


## Knowledge _in_ and knowledge _of_

-  Multiple "Fields of Policy Study" 
    -  Knowledge _of_  
        -  Policy and politics
        -  Policy process 
        -  Policy design
        -  Policymaking institutions
        -  Policy implementation  
  
    -  Knowledge _in_
        -  Policy analysis
        -  Policy evaluation 

## Policy Theory and Models

* What are models?

* How are they used? 

* Models of the _policymaking system_ and models of the _individual_

## Policymaking System

## Institutional Model

* Institutions: _Public policy is authoritatively determined, implemented, and
    enforced by government institutions_
    * Congress, the presidency, courts, bureaucracies
    * Government institutions give public policy three distinctive
    characteristics:
        * Legitimacy: legal obligations; democratic; the Constitution
        * Universality: extends to all citizens 
        * Coercion: imprison violators 

* _Government institutions provide structure to the process of policymaking_ 

## Rational Model

## Capacity for Decision-Making

-  Comprehensive rationality: _homo economicus_ 
    -  Individuals have preferences
    -  Preferences are ranked
    -  Preferences are consistent
    -  All aspects of a choice situation are known
    -  Careful weighing of costs and benefits
    -  Choice based on efficiency and “maximizing utility”

## Rationality and Public Policy

-  __Rationalist__: Comprehensive rationality in the policy
   process
    -  Policymakers can separate values from facts
    -  Policymakers have consistent policy preferences, and rank
       them to help maximize societal gain
    -  Policy is made in a linear fashion (e.g., policy stages)
    -  Comprehensive decision-making, all factors and possibilities
       considered and explored

-  Is this realistic?

## Bounded Rationality 

-  What is bounded rationality?
    -  _Humans intended to be rational but are prevented
       from behaving in a fully rational manner by cognitive
       limitations_  (Smith and Larmier, pg 49) 

-  Individuals “satisfice” not maximize

-  Use heuristics or short–cuts in the absence of complete
information

## Bounded Rationality in the Policy Process
### Incrementalism

- What is incrementalism? 
    -  Bounded rationality applied to the policy process
    -  _Path–dependent_: Policy is made through small changes to
       existing policy
    -  “root” vs. “branch”
    -  Application to agency budgetary decisions

## Group Theory

* Individuals with common interests band together
  formally or informally to press their demands on government

* _Pluralism_

* Role of political system:
    * Establish rules
    * Arrange compromises and balance interests
    * Enacting compromise (policy)
    * Enforce compromise

## Elite Theory

## Public Choice Theory

* Economic study of nonmarket decision making

* _All political actors seek to maximize their personal benefits in politics as well as the market place_

* Collective decision making leads to mutual benefit

* _Social contract_

* Market failures
    * Public goods
    * Externalities

## Game Theory

* Study of decisions in situations in which two or more rational participants have choices and the outcome depends on the choices by each

* Examples:
    * Chicken 
    * Prisoner's dilemma
    * _Deterrence_

## Policy Stages

\begin{figure}[!htp]

\end{figure}

## Policy Stages 

-  Criticisms
    -  Not a causal theory; no causal drivers, therefore no basis
       for hypotheses testing
    -  Descriptive inaccuracy; stages are not distinct
    -  Top–down focus
    -  Neglects intergovernmental relations

## Policy Stages 

-  According to _deLeon_ what does the policy stages approach
offer?
    -  __Practical utility__: allows scholars to focus on specific areas
       of the policy process
    -  __Parsimony__: it reduces complexity and is analytically useful;
       serves as a common vocabulary for scholars to utilize
    -  Useful for teaching purposes

# Epistemology

## Scientific Method  

- _A method or procedure that has characterized natural
science since the 17th century, consisting in
systematic observation, measurement, and
experiment, and the formulation, testing, and
modification of hypotheses._ 

## Criteria of a Scientific Theory
### Sabatier 2007

-  Data acquisition and analysis methods are public and can be replicated 

-  Concepts and propositions should be clearly defined, logically
    consistent, and lead to empirically falsifiable hypotheses

-  Propositions should be general
    -  Proposition: (i.e., logic statement) declarative statement
    that is either true or false 

-  Methods and concepts subjected to criticism and evaluation

## Theories and Models 

-  __Theories__: place values on variables, posit
  _casual_ relationships among variables, and make predictions 

-  __Models__: make precise assumptions about a limited set of
  parameters and variables
    -  Deterministic models: 

        -  $$Y_{i} = \alpha + \beta X_{i}$$ 

    -  Probabilistic models:

        -  $$Y_{i} = \alpha + \beta X_{i} + \epsilon_i$$

## Theories and Models 
### Thomas Dye

* Order and simplify reality

* Identify what is significant

* Be congruent with reality

* Provide meaningful communication

* Direct inquiry and research

* Suggest explanations
