# Course Schedule and Readings Fall 2015
__SUBJECT TO CHANGE__. All changes will be announced in class.

__READINGS SHOULD BE READ IN THE ORDER LISTED__ 

For most weeks, readings will be categorized as core readings, discussion readings, and suggested readings. _For the journal articles click on the link to be taken to the website for the article. Note that to be able to download the article from the link you need to be connected to the internet on campus or, if off campus, you need to search for the journal article at the [library website](http://www.cofc.edu/library/)._ Additional readings will also be available on OAKS. 

* __Core Readings (Required)__: The core readings detail theoretical concepts and will be covered by lecture.

* __Discussion Readings (Required)__: The discussion readings
  are largely applications of theoretical concepts. They will be
  covered through class discussion, lead by assigned discussion
  leaders.
  
* __Suggested Readings (Not Required)__: Suggested readings
  are additional readings that could help clarify some concepts. They
  are also useful places to start for the research design. 

I will also provide links to Professor Paul Cairney's series of essays on [key policy theories and concepts in 1000 words](https://paulcairney.wordpress.com/1000-words/). These are __STRONGLY__ recommended.
