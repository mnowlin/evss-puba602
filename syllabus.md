# Course Description

__See the [course website](http://matthewcnowlin.com/evss-puba602/) for updates__

**EVSS**: This course seeks to develop a firm understanding of the
public policy–making process in the United States. Students study policy
making through various perspectives on implementation. The roles of
major institutions including the executive, legislative and judicial
branches of government, the bureaucracy and interest groups in this
process are addressed. Includes various perspectives and interpretations
of policymaking, including incrementalism, rationalism, pluralism and
elitism. Selected areas of public policy, including transportation,
poverty, energy and the environment are used to illustrate both the
process and the different perspectives.

**PUBA**: This course examines the activities of individuals, groups,
and institutions that define or ignore public problems, participate or
fail to participate in political struggles over these problems and
confront or avoid opportunities to develop and implement solutions. The
implications of these complexities for public employees and public
management are emphasized.

Learning Outcomes 
-----------------

The Masters of Public Administration accrediting body, the Network of
Schools of Public Policy, Administration, and Affairs (NASPAA) requires
that we assess our students’ mastery of the following required
competencies:

-   Lead and manage in public governance

-   Participate in and contribute to the public policy process

-   Analyze, synthesize, think critically, solve problems, and make
    decisions

-   Articulate and apply a public service perspective

-   Communicate and interact productively with a diverse and changing
    workforce and citizenry

Each of these competencies will be addressed throughout this course,
however the most emphasis will be placed on developing students
abilities to a) participate in and contribute to the public policy
process, and to b) analyze, synthesize, think critically, solve
problems, and make decisions.

In addition, this course has several specific learning objectives.

-   Gain an introductory understanding of the academic field of public
    policy

-   Gain a general understanding of the major policy process theories

-   Develop a detailed understanding of one substantive area of public
    policy

-   Gain a practical understanding of how the theories of the policy
    process can help understand and explain a substantive policy area

-   Develop oral, written, and group communication skills

These objectives will be achieved through critically reading the course
readings; by actively participating in and leading in-class discussions;
and by completing a research design applying one of the major frameworks
to a particular substantive policy area.

Required Texts: 
===============

The following texts are required and additional readings will be
provided on OAKS.

Additional Readings 
-------------------

For most weeks, readings will be categorized as core readings,
discussion readings, and suggested readings.

-   **Core Readings (Required)**: The core readings detail theoretical
    concepts and will be covered by lecture.

-   **Discussion Readings (Required)**: The discussion readings are
    largely applications of theoretical concepts. They will be covered
    through class discussion, lead by assigned discussion leaders.

-   **Suggested Readings (Not Required)**: Suggested readings are
    additional readings that could help clarify some concepts. They are
    also useful places to start for the research design.

The reading assignments and links to the readings on are the [schedule](http://matthewcnowlin.com/evss-puba602/schedule.html) portion of the [course website](http://matthewcnowlin.com/evss-puba602/index.html)


Course Requirements and Grading: 
================================

Performance in this course will be evaluated on the basis of 10
discussion papers, being a discussion leader, a research design, a book review, and class participation. Points will be distributed as follows:

| Assignment                | Points |
| --- | --- |
|  10 Discussion Papers      | 20 points each (200 points) (22%) |
|  Discussion Leader         | 100 points (11%) |
|  Research Design Proposal  | 50 points (6%) |
|  Research Design           | 250 points (28%) |
|  Book Review               | 200 points (22%) |
|  Attendance/Participation  | 100 points (11%) |
| --- | --- |
|  Total                     | 900 points (100%) |


There are 900 possible points for this course. Grades will be allocated
based on your earned points and calculated as a percentage of 900.

  Letter Grade | Percentage 
  --- | --- 
  A  |  90 to 100%
  B+ |  87 to 89%
  B  |  80 to 86%

## Attendance and Participation 

Attendance is expected and mandatory for this course. Attendance will be
taken by the participation statements you turn in at the end of each
class, so even if you did not participate in class, fill out the survey
in OAKS or put your name on a piece of paper and give it to me at the
end of class. You are allowed to miss one class without penalty. The
penalties for missing 2 or more classes are as follows (in addition to
the loss of participation points):

   Absences | Penalty
   --- | ---
      1   |   None
      2   |   20 points
      3   |   30 points (50 points total)
      4   |   40 points (90 points total)
      5   |   50 points (140 points total)


Students are expected to participate in the course by
asking questions, providing thoughtful comments, and through making
contributions to the discussion portion of class. **Class discussion
should be better than it would have been had you not attended.** Note that the professor has final say over what does or does not count as adequate participation.

Students with Disabilities: 
===========================

The College will make reasonable accommodations for persons with
documented disabilities. Students should apply at the Center for
Disability Services located on the first floor of the Lightsey Center,
Suite 104. Students approved for accommodations are responsible for
notifying me as soon as possible and for contacting me at least one week
before any accommodation is needed.

Cheating or Plagiarism: 
=======================

A grade of zero will be given to anyone cheating on any exam, homework
assignment or committing plagiarism in a paper. As commonly defined,
plagiarism consists of passing off as ones own ideas, the words,
writings, music, graphs/charts, etc that were created by another. In
accordance with this definition, you are committing plagiarism if you
copy the work of another person and turn it in as your own, even if you
have the permission of that person. It does not matter from where the
material is borrowed–a book, article, material off the web, another
student’s paper–all constitute plagiarism unless the source of the work
is fully identified and credited. Plagiarism is cheating and a violation
of academic and personal integrity and will not be tolerated. It carries
extremely serious consequences. To avoid plagiarism it is necessary when
using a phrase, a distinctive idea, concept or sentence from another
source to reference that source in your text, a footnote, or end-note.
Please contact me if you need assistance in citing a source.

Religious Holiday Policy: 
=========================

It is the policy of the College to excuse absences of students that
result from religious observances and to provide without penalty for the
rescheduling of examinations and additional required class work that may
fall on religious holidays. Please see me immediately if you will need
to miss class any time during this semester.
